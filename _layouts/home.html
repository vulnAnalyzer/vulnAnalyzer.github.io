  Identifying vulnerable APIs is critical for enhancing software security, yet existing methods face challenges such as
  incomplete patch information, noisy code changes, and limitations of large language models (LLMs). Public
  vulnerability knowledge bases (e.g., the Snyk vulnerability database) often contain inconsistent or missing patch
  data. Furthermore, patch commits frequently include both security fixes and unrelated modifications, which reduces
  detection accuracy. While LLMs have shown strong capabilities in code understanding, they suffer from input length
  constraints and may be distracted by irrelevant context, leading to false positives.<br/>

  To address these issues, we propose <strong>VULNANALYZER</strong>, a novel framework that combines static analysis with LLMs
  guided by vulnerability context prompts. Specifically, we first collect vulnerability metadata (e.g., CVEs, CWEs,
  vulnerable and patched versions) from the GitHub Advisory Database. Next, we use static analysis to extract source
  code differences between patched and adjacent vulnerable versions of libraries. Finally, we leverage LLMs, guided by
  carefully constructed vulnerability context prompts, to identify vulnerable APIs within these code differences. By
  focusing on method-level granularity, <strong>VULNANALYZER</strong> effectively mitigates input size limitations and reduces
  hallucinations, enabling more accurate and fine-grained vulnerability detection. This approach advances the
  reliability of vulnerability analysis in modern software ecosystems.
